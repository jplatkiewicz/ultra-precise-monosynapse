# ultra-precise-monosynapse
# Introduction
The codes in this repository were used to produce the figures in (Platkiewicz et al., in preparation).

# Requirements
The codes require NumPy, SciPy, Brian 2, and Matplotlib.

# Instructions to Run
All the functions to plot the figures are called in 'figures_manuscript_jp.py'.

In the command-line interface, type 'python -c "import figures_manuscript_jp; figures_manuscript_jp.plot_figure(number)"', where 'number' indicates the figure number to plot (from 1 to 2). 

Note: the values suggested for the functions' inputs have been chosen small to shorten the computation time. Larger values are required to obtain results similar to the manuscript's figures.
